   	<h4 class = "indentParagraph"><u>Course Description</u></h4>
    	<p class = "indentParagraph2">Speciation is fundamental to evolutionary biology and is the process by which new biological species arise. We have only recently begun to understand the process of speciation in marine organisms. Few extrinsic barriers to gene flow exist in the sea; therefore, marine speciation challenges the idea of allopatric speciation (new species only arise when populations are geographically isolated).</p>

		<p class = "indentParagraph2">This course will review the evolutionary concepts associated with the process of speciation, with a particular emphasis on the mechanisms of speciation. We will then delve into the primary literature to examine and critique speciation studies in marine organisms. Topics covered in this course include as they relate to marine organisms: biodiversity, modes of speciation, reproductive isolation, species concepts, mate recognition, natural selection, cospeciation, sexual conflict, sexual selection, and reinforcement. At the very least, students should have a basic understanding of evolution prior to taking this course.</p>

        <p class = "indentParagraph2">OCMB - 6090 and MEVS - 5160</p>
   	<h4 class = "indentParagraph"><u>Course Description</u></h4>
    	<p class = "indentParagraph2">This course gives a general overview of fertilization ecology focusing in marine free‐spawning invertebrates and fish. Students will compare the many obstacles to reproductive success in free‐spawning marine organisms (i.e., distance, dilution, timing, egg location, species specificity, competition, prevention of polyspermy) to the potential benefits of this reproductive strategy. Topics covered in this course include: sperm chemotaxis, gamete recognition proteins, sperm competition, sperm motility, polyspermy, Allee Effect, gamete aging, fertilization models and the effect of hydrodynamics on fertilization. This course will consist of lecture, discussions, and laboratory experiments.</p>
    
<!--		Coral Reef Ecology			-->

        <p class = "indentParagraph2">OCMB - 6470 and MEVS - 5165</p>
   	<h4 class = "indentParagraph"><u>Course Description</u></h4>
    	<p class = "indentParagraph2">The decline of coral reefs worldwide is a pressing concern for scientists and managers.  It is important to understand the complex ecological relationships of coral reefs in order to determine how this diverse ecosystem will respond to current and future threats.  This course will introduce students to the ecology of coral reefs and associated ecosystems (i.e., seagrass and mangrove communities), the general biology of scleractinian corals, and the taxonomy of important coral reef organisms.  Material will be presented from a global perspective, with a focus on South Florida and Caribbean coral reefs.  Active classroom discussion will be encouraged during and following the presentation of material by the professor.  A formal discussion period on selected papers will be conducted during each class.  Attendance on a mandatory field trip is required.</p>
